/**
 * The substring hash will trade gobs and gobs of memory in order to
 * give you extremely fast lookups on any substring of a key. For
 * instance, if I want to index the object Bob on key "bob", then the
 * SubstringHash would allow me to make O(1) lookups on "b", "o",
 * "bo", "ob", and "bob".
 *
 * n^2 is a reasonable estimate for the number of substrings in any
 * given string.  The actual number can be constrained by setting the
 * keyMin and keyMax properties.  min 2 for instance would only index
 * "bob" on "bo", "ob", and "bob".
 *
 * False positive and long lookup fix:
 * In order to get around the following problem I potentially index on
 * more than just the substrings less than the keyMax. here's the
 * problem - let's say you set the keyMax to 5, and you ask to index
 * on "foobar", then just indexing on substrings beteen keyMin and
 * keyMax we'll actually index on foobars.substrings(1,5). that is all
 * substrings in length between 1 and 5.  that means on a lookup if
 * you ask for "foobar" - that substring isn't actually part of that
 * set.  so... easy fix right?  just cut "foobar" down to "fooba" you
 * say.  well if the lookup key was "foobad" then cutting the key down
 * to "fooba" would generate a false positive.
 *
 * To get around this the indexed keySet is actually the unique set of
 * the original key, plus all zero indexed substrings of the key, plus
 * all substrings between keyMin and keyMax.
