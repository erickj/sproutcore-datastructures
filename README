== DataStructure & Design Pattern Library: ==

This is a haphazard attempt at implementing some useful design
patterns in a generic KVO manner along with a home for missing data
structures from the core Sproutcore frameworks that I find useful

=== Requirements ===

DataStructures has been built and tested against Sproutcore 1.5 only

=== INSTALLATION ===

In your frameworks directory, run:
  git clone git://github.com/junction/sproutcore-datastructures.git datastructures

=== Current Implementation ===

- mixins/composite:
  A mixin to make any sproutcore object a member to a bottom up
  composible DAG.  The composite pattern is useful for representing a
  larger object as a set of discrete parts.  This implementation is a
  modification of the composite pattern described in the gang of four
  book.

- system/query_array:
  Can be thought of like a generic RecordArray that is NOT tied to the
  store.  It allows you to apply an SC.Query (from datastore
  framework) to any array like object and end up with a 0 indexed
  fully observable array.

- system/basic_index & system/substring_hash:
  A very dirty lookup table implementation.  Likely to change severely
  in the future
