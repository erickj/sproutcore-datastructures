== DataStructure & Design Pattern Library: ==

This is a haphazard attempt at implementing some useful design
patterns in a generic KVO manner along with a home for missing data

=== INSTALLATION ===

In your frameworks directory, run:
  git clone git://github.com/junction/sproutcore-datastructures.git datastructures
