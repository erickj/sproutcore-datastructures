== DataStructure & Design Pattern Library: ==

This is a haphazard attempt at implementing some useful design
patterns in a generic KVO manner along with a home for missing data
structures from the core Sproutcore frameworks that I find useful

=== Requirements ===

DataStructures has been built and tested against Sproutcore 1.5 only

=== INSTALLATION ===

In your frameworks directory, run:
  git clone git://github.com/junction/sproutcore-datastructures.git datastructures
